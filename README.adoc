== Summary

This application demonstrates how to use the MuleSoft 4 error handling in different scenarios with different types of errors.

It includes examples of how to handle errors in a MuleSoft application, including connectivity errors, validation errors, and transformation errors.

== Error Handling in MuleSoft 4:

MuleSoft 4 provides a robust error handling framework to manage and respond to errors effectively.

The error handling mechanism is based on the following key components:

 1. Try Scope:
    - Encapsulates a block of code where errors might occur.
    - Allows you to handle errors locally within the scope.

 2. Error Types:
    - MuleSoft categorizes errors into different types (e.g., `CONNECTIVITY`, `VALIDATION`, `TRANSFORMATION`).
    - Each error type has a namespace and a specific error code.

 3. Error Handlers:
    - `On Error Continue`: Allows the flow to continue execution after handling the error.
    - `On Error Propagate`: Propagates the error to the parent flow or caller after handling it.

 4. Error Propagation:
    - Errors can be propagated to higher levels in the flow hierarchy.
    - Use `raise-error` to explicitly raise custom errors.

 5. Logging and Debugging:
    - Use the `Logger` component to log error details for debugging purposes.
    - Access error attributes such as `error.description`, `error.errorType.namespace`, `error.errorType.identifier`, and `error.detailedDescription`.

 6. Global Error Handling:
    - Define global error handlers to manage errors across multiple flows.
    - Use the `Error Handler` component at the application level.

Example Use Case:
 - A flow that connects to an external API might use a `Try` scope to handle connectivity errors.
 - If an error occurs, an `On Error Continue` block can log the error and provide a fallback response.

Best Practices:
 - Always handle errors explicitly to avoid unexpected application behavior.
 - Use meaningful error messages and codes for better debugging and maintenance.
 - Test error scenarios thoroughly to ensure the application behaves as expected.

== HTTP Status

The application tries to mock a variety of HTTP status codes, including:

- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 204 No Content
- 209 Already Reported / Conflict
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not Found
- 405 Method Not Allowed
- 409 Conflict
- 410 Gone
- 415 Unsupported Media Type
- 422 Unprocessable Entity
- 429 Too Many Requests
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 502 Bad Gateway
- 503 Service Unavailable
- 504 Gateway Timeout
- 511 Network Authentication Required
