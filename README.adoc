== Summary

This application demonstrates how to use the MuleSoft 4 error handling in different scenarios with different types of errors.

It includes examples of how to handle errors in a MuleSoft application, including connectivity errors, validation errors, and transformation errors.

== Error Handling in MuleSoft 4:

MuleSoft 4 provides a robust error handling framework to manage and respond to errors effectively.

The error handling mechanism is based on the following key components:

. Error Types:
** MuleSoft categorizes errors into different types (e.g., `CONNECTIVITY`, `VALIDATION`, `TRANSFORMATION`).
** Each error type has a namespace and a specific error code.

. Error Handlers:
** `On Error Continue`: Allows the flow to continue execution after handling the error.
** `On Error Propagate`: Propagates the error to the parent flow or caller after handling it.

. Scopes:
** Try Scope:
*** Encapsulates a block of code that may throw an error.
*** Allows you to define specific error handling logic for that block.
** Until Successful Scope:
*** Repeats a block of code until it succeeds or reaches a maximum
   

. Error Propagation:
** Errors can be propagated to higher levels in the flow hierarchy.
** Use `raise-error` to explicitly raise custom errors.

. Logging and Debugging:
** Use the `Logger` component to log error details for debugging purposes.
** Access error attributes such as `error.description`, `error.errorType.namespace`, `error.errorType.identifier`, and `error.detailedDescription`.

. Global Error Handling:
** Define global error handlers to manage errors across multiple flows.
** Use the `Error Handler` component at the application level.

Example Use Case:
** A flow that connects to an external API might use a `Try` scope to handle connectivity errors.
** If an error occurs, an `On Error Continue` block can log the error and provide a fallback response.

Best Practices:
** Always handle errors explicitly to avoid unexpected application behavior.
** Use meaningful error messages and codes for better debugging and maintenance.
** Test error scenarios thoroughly to ensure the application behaves as expected.

== HTTP Status

The application tries to mock a variety of HTTP status codes, including:

- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 204 No Content
- 209 Already Reported / Conflict
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not Found
- 405 Method Not Allowed
- 409 Conflict
- 410 Gone
- 415 Unsupported Media Type
- 422 Unprocessable Entity
- 429 Too Many Requests
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 502 Bad Gateway
- 503 Service Unavailable
- 504 Gateway Timeout
- 511 Network Authentication Required
